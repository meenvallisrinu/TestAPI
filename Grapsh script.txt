Title:
Systems and Methods for Contextual Sanitization of Sensitive Data in Generative AI Workflows for Compliance and Protection

Field of the Invention:
The present invention relates to systems and methods for data protection and privacy in generative artificial intelligence systems. Specifically, it concerns real-time detection, redaction, and sanitization of sensitive information in AI inputs and outputs to ensure regulatory compliance with frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA.

Background of the Invention:
Generative AI systems, such as large language models (LLMs), have become increasingly integrated into enterprise workflows for document generation, data analysis, and conversational automation. However, these systems often interact with unstructured data containing personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and other sensitive content, posing compliance risks under data protection laws.

Existing solutions for data sanitization are primarily post-processing tools or lack contextual understanding, leading to either over-redaction (loss of useful content) or under-protection (compliance violations). There is a need for a real-time, intelligent middleware layer that can process prompts and responses in generative AI interactions while preserving meaning and ensuring compliance.

Summary of the Invention:
The invention provides a system and method for real-time contextual sanitization of prompts and responses in generative AI workflows. The system includes a middleware layer that inspects and processes data before submission to, or after generation by, an LLM or similar model.

The system:

Detects sensitive data entities using named entity recognition (NER), regular expressions, and machine learning models.

Applies configurable redaction, pseudonymization, or replacement techniques based on the operational context and selected compliance framework.

Maintains semantic coherence of AI-generated content despite sanitization.

Optionally stores metadata about sanitization actions for audit logging and post-analysis.

Provides restoration capability for redacted information in secure or authorized workflows.

FIG. 3 ‚Äì UI mockup for admin controls and compliance configuration.

FIG. 4 ‚Äì Diagram of data detection and entity classification engine.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment:
1. System Overview
The system comprises:

A Sanitization Engine that receives incoming prompts or outputs.

A Sensitive Data Detector that identifies PII/PHI using NLP and classification models.

A Compliance Policy Module that defines how to process each detected entity.

A Transformation Engine that redacts, masks, pseudonymizes, or synthetically replaces the detected data.

An optional Restoration Module for secure data reinsertion.

An Audit Logger that captures metadata about each sanitization for compliance verification.

2. Detection of Sensitive Data
The system uses:

A combination of rule-based and ML-based NER to detect common sensitive terms.

Pattern matching for known formats (e.g., credit card numbers, phone numbers).

Contextual scoring to avoid false positives (e.g., ‚ÄúApple‚Äù as fruit vs. company).

3. Contextual Sanitization
Based on user or organizational policy:

Redaction: e.g., "[REDACTED_EMAIL]"

Pseudonymization: e.g., ‚ÄúJohn Smith‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAlex J.‚Äù

Synthetic Replacement: AI generates fictitious but contextually consistent data.

4. Real-Time Middleware Functionality
The system sits between the user interface and the LLM (e.g., via API proxy), ensuring:

Prompts are sanitized before reaching the model.

Responses are post-processed for compliance before display or logging.

No sensitive data is exposed to third-party models unless authorized.

5. Logging and Explainability
Each sanitization action is logged with:

Type of data detected.

Method used (redaction, replacement).

Timestamp and user/session ID.

Confidence score and reason for action.

Patent Idea Sample
Title:
"Large Language Model-Based Contextual Anomaly Detection System for Preventing Data Exfiltration"

Abstract:
A system and method for detecting data exfiltration using a Large Language Model (LLM) that analyzes user behavior, system events, and data flow patterns in context. The invention employs pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs to semantically model sequences of activities across enterprise environments, enabling the detection of intent-based anomalies that traditional rule- or threshold-based systems often miss. The system integrates with existing security infrastructure and continuously learns from analyst feedback to improve its detection accuracy.

Background:
Conventional anomaly detection systems primarily rely on statistical thresholds, signatures, or static rule sets to identify abnormal data access or movement. However, modern cyber threats‚Äîespecially data exfiltration by insiders or through stealthy malware‚Äîare often low-volume, slow, and contextually similar to benign behavior, rendering traditional systems ineffective.

With recent advancements in natural language processing, LLMs can now understand complex patterns, relationships, and intent in textual and structured data. Applying these capabilities to security telemetry allows for a more intelligent, context-aware approach to detecting anomalous behavior.

Summary of the Invention:
This invention discloses a novel system that leverages LLMs to analyze structured and unstructured logs from multiple security data sources (e.g., SIEM, EDR, DLP, cloud activity). The LLM models sequences of user actions, access requests, and data flows as natural language-like inputs. By predicting normal behavioral patterns and identifying deviations, the system flags potential exfiltration attempts based on intent and behavior rather than just quantity or frequency.

The invention includes:

A data ingestion and normalization pipeline.

A behavior modeling engine based on an LLM (e.g., GPT, LLaMA).

A scoring engine that combines LLM-based semantic anomaly scores with traditional risk metrics.

An interactive analyst interface for reviewing incidents and providing feedback.

A continuous learning mechanism that updates model understanding based on analyst decisions and evolving organizational norms.

Key Features:
Contextual anomaly detection using LLM embeddings and prompt-based reasoning.

Ability to correlate events across different timeframes and systems.

Summarization and prioritization of alerts using natural language explanations.

Feedback loop to fine-tune model behavior and reduce false positives.

Example Claims:
A system comprising:

A data ingestion module configured to receive logs from network, endpoint, cloud, and identity sources;

A preprocessing module to convert said logs into tokenized sequences;

A Large Language Model (LLM) configured to model behavioral sequences and detect anomalies based on semantic deviation;

A detection module that assigns risk scores to user activity based on LLM predictions and metadata; and

A feedback mechanism for updating model parameters based on analyst input.

The system of claim 1, wherein the LLM is trained to identify intent behind user actions by interpreting log sequences as natural language-like structures.

The system of claim 1, wherein the system generates a natural language summary describing the reason for an anomaly score.

The system of claim 1, further comprising a visualization dashboard for interactive investigation of flagged events and user behavior history.



Uniqueness & Novelty
Here's how your idea stands out from existing solutions:

1. Semantic Understanding of Security Events
Novelty: Unlike traditional systems that rely on thresholds, static rules, or pattern matching (e.g., regex, statistical baselines), this system treats sequences of user and system actions like a language, enabling semantic analysis of behavior. The LLM can "understand" why something is anomalous ‚Äî not just that it deviates statistically.

üí° Unique angle: Transforming security event logs into natural-language-style sequences for LLM interpretation.

2. Intent-Based Detection Rather Than Signature-Based
Novelty: Most DLP or SIEM systems flag exfiltration based on data volume, file types, or destination domains. This invention leverages the LLM‚Äôs ability to infer user intent (e.g., ‚Äúaccessed customer database after resignation email,‚Äù or ‚Äúused personal email to send HR documents‚Äù), which is far more sophisticated.

üí° Unique angle: Detecting threats by interpreting context and behavioral intent, not just events in isolation.

3. Cross-Domain Behavioral Correlation via LLM
Novelty: Traditional systems silo data from endpoints, cloud, identity, and network sources. Your solution uses an LLM to reason across domains (e.g., a VPN login, file access, and Slack message) as a cohesive narrative, enabling detection of multi-step, low-noise attacks.

üí° Unique angle: An LLM that acts like a cross-platform reasoning engine, unifying disjointed signals.

4. Natural Language Explanations for Analysts
Novelty: Security alerts are often cryptic. Your system explains anomalies in plain English using the LLM, allowing analysts to understand and act on threats faster.

üí° Unique angle: Converts low-level log data into high-level natural language rationales, improving analyst response time and reducing fatigue.

5. Feedback-Driven Adaptive Learning Loop
Novelty: Analyst feedback on alerts is used to fine-tune model prompts or retrain detection pipelines, creating a self-optimizing anomaly detection system tailored to each organization's environment.

üí° Unique angle: Integration of supervised human feedback in an LLM pipeline for personalized anomaly detection.

Feature / Aspect	Traditional Systems / Prior Art	Proposed Invention (LLM-Based System)	Novelty / Advantage
1. Behavior Modeling Technique	Statistical models, signature-based, rule-based heuristics	Uses an LLM to model user/system behavior as sequences similar to natural language	Introduces a semantic, sequence-aware detection paradigm
2. Intent Detection	Cannot infer user intent; flags only obvious anomalies (e.g., file size, IP reputation)	Detects subtle behaviors indicative of malicious intent (e.g., accessing sensitive data post-resignation)	Enables detection of insider threats or low-and-slow exfiltration
3. Multi-Source Event Correlation	Requires manual correlation or SIEM logic; lacks semantic linking	LLM performs contextual correlation across domains (e.g., login + file access + email)	Automatically synthesizes multi-domain event narratives
4. Alert Explanation Mechanism	Technical logs and raw event data	Natural Language Explanations (e.g., "User attempted to email confidential PDF to personal address after hours")	Improves analyst understanding, response time, and trust
5. Analyst Feedback Loop	Manual tuning of rules; models not adaptive to environment	Uses analyst feedback to fine-tune prompts or retrain model dynamically	Continuously improves accuracy and reduces false positives
6. Prompt-Based Few-Shot Detection	No LLM prompting; rigid detection logic	Supports zero-shot/few-shot learning via LLM prompt engineering	Adapts quickly to new threat patterns without retraining from scratch
7. Deployment Flexibility (Privacy-Aware)	Cloud-hosted, data often sent off-site	Can run on-prem or via private LLMs; supports log anonymization	Addresses regulatory and data residency concerns in sensitive environments
8. Use of Language Modeling for Logs	Logs treated as structured data only	Transforms logs into natural-language-style sequences for processing

Insider Threats in Cloud Workflows	Flags unusual data pulls from BigQuery or Snowflake by users outside the usual data team

 LLM-Powered Anomaly Detection for Data Exfiltration in Cloud Environments
Cloud infrastructure introduces new complexity for data loss detection because:

Data moves across distributed systems, regions, and services.

Users access data from various devices and networks.

Logs and signals are fragmented across multiple tools and platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, SaaS).

Attackers exploit trusted identities or automation (e.g., service accounts, misconfigured IAM).

An LLM-driven system helps by understanding behavior, context, and intent, even in complex cloud-native environments.

IAM/identity logs: Okta, AWS IAM, Google Workspace

SaaS & productivity apps: Google Drive, M365, Dropbox

Kubernetes activity, Lambda functions, CI/CD pipelines

üß† LLM Input: Logs converted into natural-language-like sequences:
‚ÄúUser X from IP Y accessed S3 bucket Z at 2 AM via CLI, downloaded 42 files tagged CONFIDENTIAL.‚Äù

üîç 2. Semantic Anomaly Detection Using LLM
The LLM evaluates whether the action makes sense in context:

Time anomaly: Why is a DevOps engineer downloading payroll data at midnight?

Role-based anomaly: Why is a finance intern accessing Kubernetes secrets?

Volume/context mismatch: Small but sensitive file downloaded to a personal Dropbox account.

‚úÖ LLM classifies and scores the risk based on learned behavioral baselines and contextual knowledge.

üîó 3. Cross-Service Behavior Correlation
The LLM can link actions across services and time:

Example Pattern:

Unusual login from a new device (Okta)

Access to critical data lake (AWS Athena)

Creation of public S3 bucket

Upload of a ZIP file with encrypted content

üîÑ Traditional tools may flag steps independently ‚Äî LLM understands the sequence and intent and flags it as an orchestrated exfiltration attempt.

üßæ 4. Natural Language Summarization for Analysts
Instead of raw log events, the LLM summarizes incidents:

"User jane.doe accessed sensitive legal documents from OneDrive outside office hours, shared them via personal Gmail shortly after submitting a resignation ticket to HR."

This saves analysts time and helps with triage and response.

üîÅ 5. Continuous Feedback Loop
Analysts can mark incidents as false positives or real threats.

LLM learns over time via reinforcement or fine-tuning.

Behavior baselines evolve with user roles, projects, and seasons (e.g., Q4 financial reviews).

  Protecting API Calls from Unauthorized Regions/Requests
üß© Problem Context:
APIs are a crucial part of modern application architectures, enabling seamless communication between services, applications, and users. However, API calls are often exposed to external or internal users who might try to exploit vulnerabilities or bypass security measures. These calls may come from unauthorized regions, IP addresses, or devices, which can represent malicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

In cloud-native environments, where services and users are highly distributed across regions and cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), there are increased opportunities for attackers to bypass regional access restrictions, whether through IP spoofing, VPNs, or misconfigured security policies. Relying purely on traditional IP-based access control or geofencing may not be sufficient to detect and prevent these unauthorized requests.

üîí Solution Overview:
By integrating an LLM-powered anomaly detection system into your API security strategy, you can enhance traditional security mechanisms by introducing context-aware security policies that analyze:

User Behavior and Access Patterns: Detect anomalies in the location, frequency, and time of API calls.

Service-Level Context: Ensure that requests to sensitive or critical APIs are coming from authorized regions and expected services.

Request Content and Intent: Evaluate the intent behind the request by analyzing the payload and parameters, which is something standard geofencing cannot do.

üß† How It Works
1. API Call Logging & Normalization
Collect detailed logs of all incoming API requests, including:

IP address

Region (e.g., AWS region, geographic region based on IP geolocation)

User-agent/Device type

Request parameters

Timestamp

üß† LLM Input: Logs and metadata transformed into sequences to understand behavior over time:
"User john.doe from IP 1.2.3.4 accessed POST /api/finance from a VPN in Australia at 3 AM while usually accessing APIs from the US."

2. Context-Aware Region Detection
The LLM models typical user and service behaviors:

Region-Based Anomalies: It learns which regions a user or service normally interacts with, and flags anomalies when there are requests from unexpected regions (e.g., US-based user accessing an API from Asia or a different cloud region).

Device Anomalies: Flags if an API call originates from an unfamiliar device or device type, indicating a potential unauthorized request.

Unusual Time Access: Identifies abnormal access times outside the normal working hours of a user or service.

‚úÖ The LLM can correlate user activities with geolocation patterns and historical behavior to identify malicious or accidental breaches.

3. Request Intent Detection
LLM analyzes the API call and evaluates if the request content matches the expected behavior:

Data or Service Access Mismatch: Flags if a user from a different region tries to access a sensitive endpoint (e.g., finance API) without a valid business need.

Unusual API Parameters: Identifies suspicious payloads (e.g., data export requests to external systems) or API parameters indicating exfiltration (e.g., exporting customer data to an external endpoint).

Abnormal Request Patterns: Detects an unusual rate of requests or abnormal API call frequency from an unexpected region.

üß† For example:
‚ÄúAPI request from the finance service to export sensitive data is unusual for a user located in Asia, and the payload contains customer information, which is typically handled only in the US region.‚Äù

4. Cross-Service & Multi-Region Correlation
The LLM doesn't just look at isolated API calls but correlates data from multiple services:

A request to the API might be suspicious in isolation, but combined with other data (e.g., suspicious cloud account activity, unusual IAM roles, or service account anomalies), it may indicate a coordinated attack.

üí° Example:
A request to export data from an API in the US region is flagged because the user‚Äôs activity in the last 24 hours has been inconsistent (service account used inappropriately in the EU region).

5. Real-Time Prevention & Blocking
When a request is identified as originating from an unauthorized region or is out of context, the system can take real-time actions:

Block the request if it‚Äôs identified as high-risk.

Quarantine the request for manual review if the system isn‚Äôt sure.

Notify the security team with an alert and natural-language summary (e.g., ‚ÄúAPI request from IP X in unauthorized region Y attempting to access finance data‚Äù).

üîß Example Cloud Integration
Here‚Äôs an overview of how this solution could be deployed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS):

Cloud API Gateway Integration:

API Gateway logs all incoming requests to AWS CloudWatch or a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Azure Sentinel).

LLM Model:

The LLM processes and analyzes logs in real-time via Lambda or another event-driven serverless service.

Risk Scoring and Action Engine:

Based on LLM insights, the system assigns risk scores to requests.

Automatically blocks or quarantines high-risk requests.

Security Incident Dashboard:

Analysts can see a detailed, natural language summary of anomalies and trends, making it easier to understand the attack context.

üõ°Ô∏è Benefits of Using LLMs for Region/Request-based API Protection
Context-Aware Detection: Protects APIs from unauthorized regions by understanding the user's typical access patterns rather than relying on static IP-based blocking.

Dynamic Adaptation: The system can adapt to new user behaviors over time, learning from feedback and evolving risks.

Better User Experience: Minimizes false positives compared to traditional IP blocking or geofencing, ensuring that legitimate users aren‚Äôt blocked while malicious requests are stopped.

Scalable and Cloud-Native: Works seamlessly in cloud-native architectures (AWS, GCP, Azure), leveraging serverless functions and native logging services.

üìã Example Use Cases
Unauthorized Region Access:
A user based in the US suddenly makes an API request from Germany, which is out of pattern, and is immediately flagged as suspicious.

Malicious API Exploitation:
An attacker attempts to exfiltrate data from a sensitive endpoint by using an IP address that masquerades as legitimate, but the LLM detects anomalous request patterns (e.g., high data requests from an unusual region).

Increased Attack Surface Due to Cloud Misconfigurations:
API calls from public cloud resources or unauthorized services are identified and blocked before sensitive data is exposed.

Patent Idea Sample
Title:
"Large Language Model-Based Contextual Anomaly Detection System for Preventing Data Exfiltration"

Abstract:
A system and method for detecting data exfiltration using a Large Language Model (LLM) that analyzes user behavior, system events, and data flow patterns in context. The invention employs pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs to semantically model sequences of activities across enterprise environments, enabling the detection of intent-based anomalies that traditional rule- or threshold-based systems often miss. The system integrates with existing security infrastructure and continuously learns from analyst feedback to improve its detection accuracy.

Background:
Conventional anomaly detection systems primarily rely on statistical thresholds, signatures, or static rule sets to identify abnormal data access or movement. However, modern cyber threats‚Äîespecially data exfiltration by insiders or through stealthy malware‚Äîare often low-volume, slow, and contextually similar to benign behavior, rendering traditional systems ineffective.

With recent advancements in natural language processing, LLMs can now understand complex patterns, relationships, and intent in textual and structured data. Applying these capabilities to security telemetry allows for a more intelligent, context-aware approach to detecting anomalous behavior.

Summary of the Invention:
This invention discloses a novel system that leverages LLMs to analyze structured and unstructured logs from multiple security data sources (e.g., SIEM, EDR, DLP, cloud activity). The LLM models sequences of user actions, access requests, and data flows as natural language-like inputs. By predicting normal behavioral patterns and identifying deviations, the system flags potential exfiltration attempts based on intent and behavior rather than just quantity or frequency.

The invention includes:

A data ingestion and normalization pipeline.

A behavior modeling engine based on an LLM (e.g., GPT, LLaMA).

A scoring engine that combines LLM-based semantic anomaly scores with traditional risk metrics.

An interactive analyst interface for reviewing incidents and providing feedback.

A continuous learning mechanism that updates model understanding based on analyst decisions and evolving organizational norms.

Key Features:
Contextual anomaly detection using LLM embeddings and prompt-based reasoning.

Ability to correlate events across different timeframes and systems.

Summarization and prioritization of alerts using natural language explanations.

Feedback loop to fine-tune model behavior and reduce false positives.

Example Claims:
A system comprising:

A data ingestion module configured to receive logs from network, endpoint, cloud, and identity sources;

A preprocessing module to convert said logs into tokenized sequences;

A Large Language Model (LLM) configured to model behavioral sequences and detect anomalies based on semantic deviation;

A detection module that assigns risk scores to user activity based on LLM predictions and metadata; and

A feedback mechanism for updating model parameters based on analyst input.

The system of claim 1, wherein the LLM is trained to identify intent behind user actions by interpreting log sequences as natural language-like structures.

The system of claim 1, wherein the system generates a natural language summary describing the reason for an anomaly score.

The system of claim 1, further comprising a visualization dashboard for interactive investigation of flagged events and user behavior history.

You said:
uniqueness an novelity

ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs drill down into the uniqueness and novelty of your LLM-driven anomaly detection system for data exfiltration, which are critical for both patentability and market differentiation.

üß† Uniqueness & Novelty
Here's how your idea stands out from existing solutions:

1. Semantic Understanding of Security Events
Novelty: Unlike traditional systems that rely on thresholds, static rules, or pattern matching (e.g., regex, statistical baselines), this system treats sequences of user and system actions like a language, enabling semantic analysis of behavior. The LLM can "understand" why something is anomalous ‚Äî not just that it deviates statistically.

üí° Unique angle: Transforming security event logs into natural-language-style sequences for LLM interpretation.

2. Intent-Based Detection Rather Than Signature-Based
Novelty: Most DLP or SIEM systems flag exfiltration based on data volume, file types, or destination domains. This invention leverages the LLM‚Äôs ability to infer user intent (e.g., ‚Äúaccessed customer database after resignation email,‚Äù or ‚Äúused personal email to send HR documents‚Äù), which is far more sophisticated.

üí° Unique angle: Detecting threats by interpreting context and behavioral intent, not just events in isolation.

3. Cross-Domain Behavioral Correlation via LLM
Novelty: Traditional systems silo data from endpoints, cloud, identity, and network sources. Your solution uses an LLM to reason across domains (e.g., a VPN login, file access, and Slack message) as a cohesive narrative, enabling detection of multi-step, low-noise attacks.

üí° Unique angle: An LLM that acts like a cross-platform reasoning engine, unifying disjointed signals.

4. Natural Language Explanations for Analysts
Novelty: Security alerts are often cryptic. Your system explains anomalies in plain English using the LLM, allowing analysts to understand and act on threats faster.

üí° Unique angle: Converts low-level log data into high-level natural language rationales, improving analyst response time and reducing fatigue.

5. Feedback-Driven Adaptive Learning Loop
Novelty: Analyst feedback on alerts is used to fine-tune model prompts or retrain detection pipelines, creating a self-optimizing anomaly detection system tailored to each organization's environment.

üí° Unique angle: Integration of supervised human feedback in an LLM pipeline for personalized anomaly detection.

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Let‚Äôs adapt your LLM-driven anomaly detection concept into a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) framework. We'll refocus the idea so it's not just about detecting anomalies but preventing data loss before or as it happens ‚Äî while keeping the LLM-powered intelligence front and center.



Novelty and Uniqueness
1. Context-Aware Real-Time Sanitization in AI Middleware
Unlike conventional tools that sanitize data post-processing or via static rules, this invention introduces:

A real-time middleware layer integrated with generative AI APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

Intercepts and sanitizes both prompts and responses before/after LLM interaction.

Maintains semantic context despite redaction or pseudonymization, ensuring the model‚Äôs response remains meaningful.

Uniqueness:
No known systems provide context-preserving sanitization in transit between user and LLM with dynamic policy enforcement.

2. Multi-Modal Policy Engine Based on Regulatory Frameworks

Auto-detects jurisdictional or industry-specific data requirements.

Allows admin-level configuration per data class or sensitivity score.

Supports multiple levels of anonymization or synthetic replacement.

Uniqueness:
Most existing tools apply blanket policies. This engine offers regulation-specific, fine-grained controls, including audit trails for each policy application.

3. Synthetic Data Substitution Using Generative AI
The invention doesn‚Äôt just redact ‚Äî it can:

Replace sensitive values with synthetically generated but semantically aligned alternatives, using a local or cloud-based model.

E.g., replace "John Smith, a cardiologist from New York" with "Jane Doe, a neurologist from Boston" without altering the document‚Äôs logic or flow.

Uniqueness:
Synthetic data replacement with contextual consistency generation is rarely implemented in real-time, especially for generative AI prompts/responses.

4. Auditability and Restoration for Secure Contexts
All sanitization actions are logged with metadata (who, what, when, why).

Optionally allows reversible redactions for secure/internal workflows, using encryption or token mapping.

5. Plug-and-Play Architecture with LLM Providers
Easily integrates with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.) via API proxying.

Functions independently of the LLM‚Äôs internals ‚Äî i.e., model-agnostic.

Middleware approach enables broad adoption without retraining or fine-tuning models.

Uniqueness:
Acts as a ‚Äúsanitization firewall‚Äù for AI, which is a novel architectural concept combining AI safety, privacy, and legal compliance.
